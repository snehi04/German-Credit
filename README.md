Steps to check the Credibility of the Data
Objective
The objective of this project is to classify people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. 
Build a model to predict the credit risk associated with a customer, based on his profile attributes.

Objective of Analysis:
	Minimization of risk and maximization of profit on behalf of the bank.
	To minimize loss from the bank’s perspective, the bank needs a decision rule regarding who to give approval of the loan and who not to. An applicant’s demographic and socio-economic profiles are considered by loan managers before a decision is taken regarding his/her loan application.
	The German Credit Data contains data on 21 variables and the classification whether an applicant is considered a Good or a Bad credit risk for 1000 loan applicants.  A predictive model developed on this data is expected to provide a bank manager guidance for making a decision whether to approve a loan to a prospective applicant based on his/her profiles.

Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).
